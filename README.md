# Portfolio
You can find 10 folders within my repository.

Astroids folder: This was an embedded systems project I did last year. We used an embedded board with an LCD to program the game 'Astroids' onto. You can look up the board, it is the LCP4088 with a LCD added on to the back of it. I still have the board and can demonstrate the game for you.

Embedded Briefcase: This was another project I did on the very same board mentioned above. In this project I designed a security system that was made to be attached to a briefcase. The security system was designed to detect a robbery of the briefcase and to lock once it had detected extreme movement (as if someone was running with it). It was capable of locking the briefcase with a 4 digit digital code. There was a timer within this board which if not defused within a specific given time, would sound an alarm. In this project we made use of Buffers, interrupts and timers. The language I used was C.

Java: In this project I had to create a banking system that would identify transactions and record them. The system was designed with a GUI which took inputs from many different classes. You can find all of the source code within that file.

LEGO: You can find more detail on the projects on my CV. I was given different challenges and tasks within my employment at Northumbria University while using the LEGO MINDSTORM EV3. This is a kit that has the potential to do anything you want it to by programming and creating a robot out of LEGO. I used iRobot to program the EV3 and used C primarily. My work on this kit was to find the potential in robot programming and applying it to a bigger robot.

Mobiles development: This was an individual project to create an app for Android phones using Android Studio and Java. I created a 'Contacts' app which was designed to store contacts of individuals. This app was made to create, edit, update and delete contact information with the proper optimization for different resolutions and screens including tablets. I also created UML diagrams and Class diagrams for this project.

Pong: this was another embedded project on the LCP4088 board. I created a 1 player bong game. This project was really fun, I learned to develop in C for the first time. 

Website (Part A and B): In my first year at university I made a full website using HTML and CSS. Later in the year for the second part of my assignment, I started to expand the website and used PHP and Javascript. This website includes forms, administration, logins and stores data into a database uses SQL.

Ringbuffer and semaphore: these are two small areas I covered within my course in my second year at university. I used C to program for these projects and the LCP4088 board.
