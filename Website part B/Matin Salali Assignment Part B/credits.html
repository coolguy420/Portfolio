			<h3>Security consideration</h3>
			<p>Security is a very large part of websites and anyone who is enquiring a website should consider its security to protect the information of the company and their users and customer. This website has been designed with many security considerations and I have made sure that this website is secure. If you decide to expand your site to include for example a login for your admin page, or a registration system for your customers or even online booking there are several issues and risks you need to be aware of. You need to be aware of hackers that want to either modify or interrupt the website or in a worse case scenario, gain access to information about your business or your customers. Using a non-standard port can enusre to fight againts hackers(ie, not port 80 or 443) which makes it a lot harder for anyone to access the website without premission. Using multiple firewalls also isn't a bad idea - the more firewalls you have the harder a hacker will have to work to get access to the site. Avoid opening any strange emails you receive because they could be a scam that will give the sender all your information including username and password and your port. Keeping you software and web applications is also a very good idea because sometimes software developers find a vulnerability with their software and they patch it to fix it. If you do not update your software you are not protected by the latest security patches which essentially makes it easier for others to get unauthorised access to your website.</p>
			<br /> 

			

			<p>When it comes to forms for registrations, logins and online bookings you should ensure that encryption is used and that any credit card details captured are stored separately to other personal information. This will make it much harder for someone to get access to confidential information, and in the event that they manage to get someone's personal details, they will not instantly have access to credit card details. You should also consider getting a digital certificate for the site and using Secure Socket Layer to protect data as it is passed across the internet. Not only does this make the site more secure but it can make your customers feel more confident that their data will be safe when they see the padlock symbol and HTTPS at the front of the URL. For this website i used the POST method for my form, this is because it makes your website more secure. Using POST will not share any information with the end user when they submit the form however, the GET method shows exactly which values were entered for which field in the URL of the page. That means they can see where your code is going. Using the GET method will allow hackers to easily access your information. It also enables someone to bookmark the data which they can go back to at anytime to see that inforamtion via the users bookmarks. These are the reasons why i used the POST method for the form on this website. The GET method should only be used while testing the PHP for your form. You can ensure extra security by doing very simple additions, for example using password fields for passwords adds extra security to your form, beacuse the characters will not show which makes it safer for the user incase someone is trying to look at someone else's password. Finally, for more security you can validate the data on the server side as well as client side, for example, ensuring an email address contains an @ symbol and at least one full stop, can add extra security to a form by preventing people from entering unwanted data that could potentially allow them access to secure data.</p>
